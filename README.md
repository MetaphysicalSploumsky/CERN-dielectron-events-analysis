# CERN Dielectron Events Analysis

This repository contains my analysis of 100k dielectron events released by the CMS collaboration (McCauley, Thomas; (2014). Events with two electrons from 2010. CERN Open Data Portal. DOI:10.7483/OPENDATA.CMS.PCSW.AHVG). The end goal here is to build a regression model capable of predicting the invariant mass of two electrons.
